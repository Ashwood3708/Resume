Self evaluation 2023


2023 at target has been a very fruitful one. During this year I was once again able to gain new skills and put others to use.
I learned the properties of mongo and the differences between it and postgres. I interacted with the splat team as we began to onboard all our new apis with it.
During this year my team Axon went through a modernization effort to reformat all of our services.

With axon's push to implement the next archetcture we ran into multiple issues:
- api versions were undocumented and out of sync in tap.
- platform connector versions were out of sync between all apis.
- axon's daily work load was unknown affecting the team's confidence in the new apis.

So, during innovation week I used my time to solve some of the teams common headaches.
I did this by researching metrics and creating dashboards within grafana,
With this we were able to solve the above issues.
These dashboards were very useful during the platform connector upgrades and stress test done before peak.
Also I wish to note a few things I accomplished this year.

During this time:
I have spear headed the remodel of the Axon OPU SFM flow.
I defined the metrics needed for real time reporting.
I developed and deployed the multiple apps to stream our calculations (8 apps).
I implemented alerts to hasten the teams response to system issues.
I collaborated with the team to repair failing apis with new solutions that prevent the issue from reoccuring.
I tested and implemented changes to our main aggregation api that resulted in faster processing and recovery time.
I participated in target Demo day where I show cased the new framework that axon team has been developing garnering much attention.

Last year my goals were:
- onboard the axon framework which will decrease our pain points and increase our deployment efficiency.
- second is to lead more initiatives to benefit the team.
- interact more with other teams and learn different development strategies in preparation for future advancement.

I believe that I completed these goals this year and im very satisfied with the results.
For the year of 2024 I wish to focus contributing to the teams technical roadmap,
implement design patterns of easily testable/understandable code, and advocate for improvements the team can adopt.
