Self evaluation 2024


2024 at Target has been a highly productive and insightful year. This year has provided many learning opportunities as I took on new challenges, contributed to key initiatives, and expanded my technical skill set.
One of the biggest hurdles this year was the modernization of our legacy framework. With the team managing three different frameworks in production—FPC, Axon-V1, and Axon-V2—onboarding Axon-V2 introduced both complexity and learning opportunities. Throughout this process, I gained valuable skills, including:
* Unit and functional testing practices using Groovy
* Utilizing team code libraries effectively
* Working with MongoDB as a service

Beyond technical growth, my contributions positively impacted the team in several ways:
* Technical roadmaps & story planning – Actively contributed to shaping our modernization efforts.
* Increased testing & code quality – Advocated for best practices and improved test coverage.
* Application & code consistency – Helped establish and maintain coding standards.

This year, I also participated in Innovation Week, where I:
* Collaborated in a team of three
* Took part in planning & brainstorming sessions
* Gathered and analyzed data to assess feasibility
* Compared the cost of proposed solutions
* Documented findings for future reference
* Presented a demo to the team

At the start of 2024, my goals were to:
* Contribute to the team’s technical roadmap
* Implement design patterns for testable & maintainable code
* Advocate for improvements that enhance team efficiency

Looking back, I believe I successfully met these goals—and possibly exceeded them.
As I move into 2025, I want to continue building on this progress by:
- Contribute to making services more resilient & fault-tolerant.
- Work closely with product managers to better align technical decisions with business goals.
- Take ownership of key initiatives & architecture decisions
- Present technical ideas more effectively
