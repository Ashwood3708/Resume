Story work - 2025


WOPR-3665
Deployed 10+ applications with their latest versions to production using an internal automation tool, ensuring a fully refreshed cluster and zero post-deployment errors, which improved system reliability and deployment efficiency.

WOPR-3658
Implemented the 3rd phase rollout of a new feature by deploying configuration changes for targeted store locations, editing and merging a JSON config file through peer review to ensure accuracy and controlled release.

WOPR-3537
Developed a custom Groovy processor using the “cca” tool to automatically replace private/protected method modifiers with internal across Kotlin codebases, streamlining consistency and reducing manual refactoring; identified the prerequisite of removing Groovy tests due to their inability to access internal functions.

WOPR-3617
Implemented a new configuration, split-order-batching, by updating the data model and service logic, exposing it through the config API, and defining a default status—enabling controlled rollout and future feature flexibility.

WOPR-3618
Enhanced the batching service to support the split-order-batching config by updating grouping logic, refining pickup batching behavior, and implementing both unit and integration tests to ensure accuracy and reliability of the new functionality.


WOPR-3518
Optimized a Kafka consumer by filtering messages based on environment.activeNames and introducing a universal value for environment context, improving routing accuracy while reducing redundant evaluations and boosting runtime efficiency.


WOPR-3669
Strengthened data durability by updating the Mongo function handling claim work transactions to use majority read and write concerns, ensuring higher consistency and fault tolerance.

WOPR-3537
Built an automated processor (WoprReplaceMethodModifierProcessor) to scan GitHub repositories and open PRs replacing private/protected method modifiers with internal, streamlining code consistency and reducing manual refactoring effort across projects.

SPLAT-1327
Developed an automated processor to parse GitHub repositories and open PRs that remove deprecated info.application.version code blocks from application.yml files, ensuring cleaner configurations and reducing manual maintenance across projects.


WOPR-3618
Updated the batching algorithm to support store-level configuration of allowOrderSplitting, applying the logic specifically to pickup orders by switching grouping from shipmentId to shipmentLineId, and validated the functionality with integration tests—enabling greater flexibility and control in order handling

WOPR-3593
Replaced domain files with library versions, removed an unused exception handler, and implemented getWorkerOrNull() with supporting test updates—reducing redundancy, simplifying code, and improving maintainability.

WOPR-3595
Implemented ItemLocationComplianceService to streamline retrieval and transformation of item location compliance data, integrating multiple services and repositories with async processing, retries, and enhanced error handling—improving reliability, performance, and data accuracy.


WOPR-3584
Enhanced workers-v5 integration by deserializing birthDate as a nullable string, mapping it into MongoTeamMember, and defaulting unparseable values to LocalDate.EPOCH—improving data resilience and ensuring consistent handling of edge cases.

WOPR-3538
Slack: https://target.slack.com/archives/C022KNVQYEP/p1751482012444709
Investigated Kotest caching behavior by creating integration tests with IsolationMode.InstancePerRoot, confirming that cache clearing (e.g., configService.clearCache()) is not required—validating test isolation and reducing unnecessary complexity in test design.

WOPR-3513
Implemented applyMinHoldAndRounding logic to enhance pickup batching by applying minimum hold duration rules and rounding results, ensuring more accurate batch availability times and improved order handling consistency.

WOPR-3482
enhanced terminal line handling by inserting TerminalLine records with externalCompletedTs, adding retries with consumer-level handling, filtering out existing lines, and enabling parallel Mongo calls; implemented a transformer, save function, custom exception, and tests—improving data integrity, fault tolerance, and performance.

WOPR-3483
Improved terminal line processing by updating logic to skip inserting lines already in the terminal collection, integrating the check into partitionNewAndExistingLines() and validating with integration tests—ensuring data integrity, preventing duplicates, and strengthening system reliability.

WOPR-3504
Extended multi-routing logic by adding a new TOO_MANY_LINES ineligibility reason and updating MultiRoutingEligibilityService to flag shipments exceeding the configured line limit—improving batching accuracy and enforcing configurable constraints.

WOPR-3503
Introduced a configurable line cap for multi-routing by adding a max line field to MultiRoutingConfig, updating config-api transformers, and deploying the change with config scripts across environments—enabling dynamic control of batching eligibility and supporting future scalability.

WOPR-3481
Added a covered query on pickup_terminal_lines_v1 to fetch existing terminal lines by shipmentLineIds, updated logic to exclude them in partitionNewAndExistingPickupLines(), and implemented insert with retries for lines moving to terminal status—improving data integrity, fault tolerance, and performance through parallel execution.

SPLAT-1211
Enhanced the brain-plugin-v2 deployment process by introducing the autoSubmitChangeRequestForProdDeploys config, enabling automatic CR submission for production deploys and eliminating redundant user prompts—streamlining deployment efficiency while preserving team-level flexibility.

WOPR-3516
Unified ship and pickup publishing under a shared windowing mechanism to enforce line-count limits and prevent duplicate emissions. Merged publishing and upsert functions to reduce redundancy, improve data consistency, and simplify maintenance. Realigned interfaces and domains for clearer integration and more reliable publishing behavior.

WOPR-3519
Introduced environment-aware client ID generation in ship-batching-consumer, appending _DEV for development while using standard client IDs in stage and prod. Implemented getClientId to dynamically resolve client types by ShipBatchType and environment, ensuring correct routing and preventing cross-environment conflicts.

WOPR-3517
Enhanced the app-kcpt publish flow to support a configurable maxLinesPerStore limit, controlling the number of lines published per (locationId, BatchType) pair. Added a request parameter for specifying this limit and integrated logic to skip or reassign lines once a store’s threshold is reached, enabling realistic multi-routing performance testing. Updated the publish functions to filter messages by store limits and introduced a Mongo query to retrieve current line counts, ensuring accurate batching and balanced test data generation.


WOPR-3715
Implemented a container data generation service to create up to 30M containers by scaling dev data proportionally to stage counts using a rotation-based sequence. Introduced deterministic container numbering and randomized pallet IDs to ensure uniqueness and realistic test coverage. Integrated dev and stage Mongo repositories with exclusion logic for controlled load distribution. Validated the sequence logic through unit and integration tests, ensuring correctness and reliability in large-scale data generation.


WOPR-3724
I conducted the Pickup DB performance test by executing a series of load scenarios designed to simulate real-world transaction patterns, including large-scale inserts, batching, and message processing through Kafka. During the test, I closely monitored system metrics such as TPS, latency, and IOPS across all components. I captured detailed observations and performance data over the test window and compiled the results into this report, highlighting key findings and overall system behavior under stress.
