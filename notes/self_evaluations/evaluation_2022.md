Self Evaluation 2022


Evaluation:
2022 at target has been a very fruitful one. During this year I was once again able to gain new skills and put others to use. During this year my team FPC went through a huge modernization effort to reformat all of our services. During this I took part in designing our next framework in creating reusable applications for faster onboarding of our tenants. I also took this chance to better the team by introducing new standards to the team to increase our overall efficiency. Another highlight of this year is when I mentored our first rotation TLP. Where I assisted him in onboarding our grocery pipeline which is displayed on Houston for real-time reporting.

To recap my goals for 2022, I believe I completed my goal of becoming a key member of the team. For 2023, Im looking forward to completing 3 new goals. The first is to fully onboard the axon framework which will decrease our pain points and increase our deployment efficiency. Second is to lead more initiatives to benefit the team. Last is to interact more with other teams and learn different development strategies in preparation for future advancement.
